# JPmusic
A webpage for listening songs 😎
Yes, a webpage named "JPmusic" which is build in ReactJs for music lovers.🎶
Inspired by the Youtube-Music (Tried to make clone of Youtube-Music web but my mind said "hey bro, that is YOUTUBE!🙃").
There is an API which i created first for dynamic data rendering 🤞.
That API holds the song's details like title, cover, audioURL, artist, etc.
